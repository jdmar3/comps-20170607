						Directionality
					</h3>
					<aside class="notes">I want to start off by talking about the directionality of language. Then I'll give some visual examples of Spatial Agency Bias (SAB), and situate those in the context of interactive interfaces. I'll then talk about how SAB might affect interactions with those interfaces, and show some more concrete examples of survey scales involving SAB. Finally I will discuss some of the ways that I think I might study SAB in the context of a self-administered survey instrument.</aside>

							Spatial Agency Bias
					</h3>
					<aside class="notes">Spatial Agency Bias (SAB) is a theoretical model suggesting that human agency and interpretation of visual-spatial cues follows the directional orientation of the script belonging to a person’s native language. In addition to script direction the bias is moderated by habituation (exposure to another opposite-direction language may reduce it) and contextual cues related to movement (implied directionality), as well as other linguistic factors related to syntax order (Suitner & Maass, 2016). In other words, people who read left-to-right (LTR) languages (English and other Roman, Greek, and Cyrillic-scripted languages) are expected to interact with and interpret visual-spatial environments differently than people who read right-to-left (RTL) languages (Arabic, Urdu, Farsi, Hebrew).

The SAB for your language will help determine which figure you view as being in an agentic position or having greater agency With LTR spatial agency bias, this image would likely be interpreted as a dragon attacking St. George. The motion flows in the direction of the SAB. .</aside>

						Spatial Agency Bias in information objects and interfaces
					</h3>
					<aside class="notes">In the context of information objects, the expectations associated with spatial agency bias may obscure information, increase confusion, or cause people to become frustrated with interfaces. This is particularly of concern when the purpose of an interface is to elicit information, as it may also reduce trust (Joinson, 2001; Joinson, Paine, Buchanan, & Reips, 2008; Joinson, Reips, Buchanan, & Schofield, 2010). </aside>

						Spatial Agency Bias in response scales
					</h3>
					<aside class="notes">Why is this important? Interactive interfaces do not just display information to people. They are also used to elicit information from people, including sensitive or critical information. In the case of pain scales, the information being elicited can make a huge difference in how patients’ pain is dealt with. </aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img class="plain" src="img/pain-english.png" alt="English pain scale">
					<aside class="notes">In pain scales, which should be familiar to practically anyone in the United States who has been to a doctor about an injury, the faces correspond to relative levels of pain. The Wong-Baker scale uses faces to represent these abstract levels.</aside>

					<img class="plain" src="img/pain-arabic.png" alt="Arabic pain scale">
					<aside class="notes">In the Arabic version of these scales, all of the text changes direction, but the scale direction remains the same. This may have an effect on the way that an Arabic-speaking patient responds.  </aside>

					<img class="plain" src="img/pain-arabic-arrows.png" alt="Arabic pain scale with arrows">

						Investigating Spatial Agency Bias in survey interfaces
					</h3>
					<aside class="notes">The design of response scales is well-researched, with a variety experimentally verified principles to draw from in constructing new items. The visual spatial aspects of response scales also have be researched experimentally, resulting in sets of heuristics that can aid in their construction: 
						<ol>
							<li>Middle  means  typical;</li>
							<li>Left  and  top  mean  first;</li>
							<li>Near  means  related;</li>
							<li>Up  means  good;  and</li>
							<li>Like  (in  appearance)  means  close  (in  meaning) (Tourangeau, Couper, & Conrad, 2004, 2007, 2013).</li>
						</ol>
						These heuristics do not, however, take spatial agency bias into account, which may have unintended effects when applied in other than English/LTR contexts (Toepoel & Dillman, 2011)</aside>

				<section data-background="white" data-transition="slide-in none">
					<img class="plain" src="img/likert-scale.png" alt="Likert scales">
					<aside class="notes">One method for assessing the difference in response is setting up A/B or split-ballot type experiments. These would vary the directional valence of the scale items, for instance.</aside>

					<aside class="notes">This approach combined with questions about respondent native language, time spent in ESL environment, exposure to other languages, etc. will help to test for a spatial agency bias moderated by other factors than simply script direction. </aside>
